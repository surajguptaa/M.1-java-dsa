/*
Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. 
The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, 
and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). 
For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.

Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

Input:
Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.

Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.

Output:

Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. 
If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.
